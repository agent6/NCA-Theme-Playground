## 3. Course Overview

**Overview Paragraph 1**  
Create the workflow that liberates your inbox with AI. Master N8N and build something you’ll actually use: an AI‑powered email personal assistant. This hands‑on course shows you the process to create production‑ready automation.

**Overview Paragraph 2 (optional)**  
You’ll learn to integrate APIs, connect AI models, and work with triggers and workflows. Unlike theoretical tutorials, you experience the actual challenges and problem‑solving that come with building real automation — because that’s how you truly learn.

## 4. What You’ll Learn (Outcomes)

1. Understand what N8N is and how it fits into the world of AI tools, AI agents, and workflow automation.  
2. Plan effective automations so you don’t get lost in complexity as workflows grow.  
3. Build an AI‑powered email personal assistant that classifies messages, drafts replies, and organizes your inbox automatically.  
4. Integrate APIs and connect AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Grok, Claude) to power intelligent automation.  
5. Work confidently with N8N triggers (manual, webhook, schedule) and multi‑step workflows.  
6. Add Slack notifications and other downstream actions so only the important messages grab your attention.  
7. Debug real errors, handle failure cases, and gain the troubleshooting confidence to fix anything N8N throws at you.  
8. Deploy your automations from manual testing to scheduled, production‑ready workflows you can rely on.  
9. Start thinking like an AI Process Analyst — spotting automation opportunities everywhere you look.

## 5. Who This Course Is For

### ✅ This course is for…

- Knowledge workers and IT pros who are overwhelmed by email and want to automate their inbox.  
- Aspiring automation builders who want a concrete, real‑world project instead of toy examples.  
- Developers and tinkerers who want to quickly prototype AI‑powered workflows without writing an entire backend.  
- Homelab / side‑project enthusiasts who want to connect SaaS tools, AI models, and notifications together.  

### ❌ This course may not be for…

- People looking for a pure “learn N8N features” reference without building a real project.  
- Learners who prefer only polished demos with no troubleshooting or real‑world debugging.  

---

## 6. Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy and comfort using web apps.  
- Willingness to sign up for N8N and any required API providers (e.g., OpenAI, Slack).  
- Curiosity and willingness to experiment, debug, and adjust workflows.  

Optional clarifying note (1–2 sentences):  
No prior N8N or AI experience is required — the course starts from fundamentals and walks you through each step while still showing the real bumps in the road.

## 7. Curriculum / Course Content

### Module 1

**Title**  
N8N Fundamentals & Workflow Design

**Short Description (1–2 sentences)**  
Master the foundations of N8N workflow automation by learning what N8N really is, how to set it up, and how to plan effective automations. You’ll build the initial framework for your AI‑powered email assistant.

**Lesson Highlights (3–6 items, optional durations)**  
- What N8N is and how it compares to AI tools and AI agents.  
- Setting up N8N and connecting your first services.  
- Working hands‑on with the three essential triggers: Manual, Webhook, and Schedule.  
- Planning workflows so you don’t get lost in complexity as your automation grows.  
- Integrating your first API call into a workflow.  
- Building the initial skeleton for the email personal assistant workflow.  

**Labs in this Module?**  
Yes — design and implement the first version of your email assistant workflow using core triggers and a simple API integration.

---

### Module 2

**Title**  
AI Integration & Production Deployment

**Short Description**  
Take your N8N workflows to production by integrating AI models and deploying real automation that runs while you sleep.

**Lesson Highlights**  
- Connecting AI providers (OpenAI, Grok, Claude, etc.) to N8N for classification and reply drafting.  
- Understanding when to use AI agents versus simpler text classifiers.  
- Adding Slack notifications and other alerting mechanisms for high‑priority messages.  
- Implementing proper error handling, logging, and retries.  
- Transitioning from manual testing to scheduled, production triggers.  
- Hardening and monitoring your workflow so it doesn’t silently fail.  

**Labs in this Module?**  
Yes — complete and deploy a fully operational AI‑powered email assistant with Slack notifications and robust error handling.

### Additional Modules (4+)

For this course, the two skills above form the core curriculum. If future expansion is needed, new skills could cover multi‑user deployments, additional integrations (CRM, ticketing, etc.), or advanced AI agent patterns.

---

## 8. Hands‑On Labs & Practice

**Lab Overview (2–4 sentences)**  
This course is built as a single, cohesive project: an AI‑powered email personal assistant. Every major concept is introduced through a step in the workflow — from triggers and API calls to AI classification and notifications. Rather than isolated exercises, you continuously evolve the same workflow until it’s production‑ready.

**Lab Highlights (3–6 bullets)**  
- Build a complete N8N workflow that reads email, classifies messages, drafts replies, and labels messages.  
- Add Slack notifications and other outputs so you only get interrupted for what matters.  
- Debug real errors and failures as they happen, mirroring how real automation building works.  
- Move from manual runs to scheduled triggers and production deployment.  
- Leave the course with a working automation you can actually use every day.  

---

## 9. Certification Alignment (If Applicable)

**Certification Name + Code**  
None — practical project‑based course focused on real automation skills, not a vendor exam.

**Alignment Summary (2–4 sentences)**  
While this course is not built around a specific certification, it gives learners strong, practical experience in modern workflow automation, AI integration, and API‑driven systems. These skills map well to real‑world roles such as Automation Engineer, AI Process Analyst, or DevOps/Platform Engineer working with orchestration tools.

**Key Domains Covered (3–6 bullets)**  
- Workflow and process design for automation.  
- N8N fundamentals (triggers, nodes, error handling).  
- API integration and SaaS automation patterns.  
- AI model integration (classification, content generation).  
- Monitoring, troubleshooting, and production deployment.  

**Exam Disclaimer**  
This course does not prepare you for a specific certification exam; instead, it focuses on building a real, production‑ready AI workflow and the troubleshooting instincts to maintain it.

## 10. Instructor Section

**Instructor Display Name**  
Jeremy Cioara

**Short Bio (3–6 sentences, human + fun + credible)**  
Hello! If we haven’t met before, my name is Jeremy Cioara. I stepped into the training world back in 1998, teaching a group of phone technicians at US West Communications about this new technology called DSL — when I was 19 years old. Things have come a long way since then, but one thing hasn’t changed: I’m still passionate about seeing others light up when a confusing, discouraging topic suddenly clicks. These days I also bring experience from building Veeya, a company that actually does the stuff I teach, so every lesson comes from real projects and real problems.

**Key Creds / Highlights (3–5 bullets)**  
- Decades of experience designing and supporting production networks and automations.  
- Long‑time instructor known for making complex tech approachable and fun.  
- Real‑world founder of Veeya, bringing practical business and engineering experience into every course.  
- Proven track record of helping learners go from zero to confident in networking and automation.  

Optional “fun line” in NetworkChuck style:  
“I hope this has been informative for you, and I’d like to thank you for viewing.”
