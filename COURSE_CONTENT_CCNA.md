## 3. Course Overview

Two short paragraphs explaining:

**Overview Paragraph 1**  
Master CCNA skills by designing and deploying a resilient, multi‑site enterprise network for Castle Rysen Coffee — complete with routing, security, wireless, automation, and real‑world troubleshooting.

**Overview Paragraph 2 (optional)**  
This CCNA training walks learners through designing and deploying a complete, production‑ready network for Castle Rysen Coffee — a fictional but highly realistic multi‑site enterprise operating in a challenging, post‑apocalyptic world. Students build a secure, scalable network spanning a central headquarters, regional fallout shelters, and dozens of district coffee shops, learning how to keep critical services online even when everything around them is breaking.
